Hello and Welcome to My First Mile Stone Project undertaken with the Code Institute. 
   
   This project is based on a concept idea of mine to further enhance the playing experience of people who enjoy and 
par-take in the mobile game called Clash of Clans. 
   
   Clash of Clans who are unfamilar with it, is a single player based strategy video game that lets user's build up
there village with different building types which can be upgraded themselves over time after reaching certain levels. 
This increases a players strength to defend themselves against other player attacks and also to go out and attack 
other players if they desire. 
   
   As players become more and more familar with the game's indepth features , they realise that they can join other
players to form clans , with as many as 50 people coming together to do this. Within the clan , a player can
partake in clan wars against other clans, donate to other members-troops, and chat in the clan chat forum to help
out others who my need assistance with strategy for attacks or help build better defences etc..

   It is here, in the clan, that my concept idea would come into its own - A Clash of Clan - Clan Bank.
This idea would benefit the menbesrs of a clan by further enhancing the helpability of its members to each other.
Players donating funds to the clan bank , would give the over-all clan the ability to "spread the wealth" to all
its members thus increasing the speed to which they could upgrade there buildings , heroes , spells etc etc.

UX.

 So my website is for all the members of there own associated clan.
 This will give them the ability to see the Clan's Bank page, incorrperating the balance , statement , and 
 abaility to donate and request refunds from it.
 As there is no such ability in the game to do this , this is as i said, a concept idea that would enhance a
 players experience of the game , bringing them futher in game enjoyment and userability.

<ul>As a clan member - I want to be able to donate to the clan.
    As a clan leader - I want to be able to help other clan members with speeding up there troop upgrades, building 
        upgrades etc..
    As a clan member - I want to be able to see the balance of the bank and where the clan momey is being spent.
    As a clan leader - I want to be able to see the balance of the clan bank account , to be able to see
    the clan bank statement to see where the money is being spent , who has donated to the clan and who has been
    refunded money from the account.
    As a clan member - I want the ability to request a refund from the clan bank.
    As a clan leader - I want the ability to buy "gems" in the in-game shop to divide out amongst the members 
    who have donated.</ul>
