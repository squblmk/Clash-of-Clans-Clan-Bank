## UX (User Experience)
 ### **Project Goals**:
 ---
          Hello and Welcome to My First Mile Stone Project undertaken with the Code Institute.
   <p>This project is based on a concept idea of mine to further enhance the playing experience of people who enjoy and 
   partake in the mobile game called Clash of Clans.</p>
   
<p>Clash of Clans who are unfamilar with it, is a single player based strategy mobile game that lets user's build up
there village with different building types which can be upgraded themselves over time after reaching certain levels. 
This increases a players strength to defend themselves against other player attacks and also to go out and attack 
other players if they desire.</p> 
   
<p>As players become more and more familar with the game's indepth features , they realise that they can join other
players to form clans , with as many as 50 people coming together to do this. Within the clan , a player can
partake in clan wars against other clans, donate to other members-troops, and chat in the clan chat forum to help
out others who my need assistance with strategy for attacks or help build better defences etc..<p/>

<p> It is here, in the clan, that my concept idea would come into its own - A Clash of Clan - Clan Bank.
This idea would benefit the menbesrs of a clan by further enhancing the helpability of its members to each other.
Players donating funds to the clan bank , would give the over-all clan the ability to "spread the wealth" to all
its members thus increasing the speed to which they could upgrade there buildings , heroes , spells etc etc.
This is a real world scenario where if a clan member buys him or herself a set value of gems , the clan , if it bought a
higher amount of gems at a higher cost , could divide up to all that contributed to that cost , and receive far more in return for the same 
amount of money if they where to buy on there own.</p>

 ### **User Stories**:
 ---
   <p>So my website is for all the members of their own associated clan.
 This will give them the ability to see the Clan's Bank page, incorrperating the balance , statement , and 
 abaility to donate and request refunds from it.
 As there is no such ability in the game to do this , this is as i said, a concept idea that would enhance a
 players experience of the game , bringing them futher in game enjoyment and userability.</p>

<ul><li>As a clan member - I want to be able to donate to the clan.</li>
    <li>As a clan leader - I want to be able to help other clan members with speeding up there troop upgrades, building 
        upgrades etc..</li>
    <li>As a clan member - I want to be able to see the balance of the bank and where the clan momey is being spent</li>
    <li>As a clan leader - I want to be able to see the balance of the clan bank account , to be able to see
    the clan bank statement to see where the money is being spent , who has donated to the clan and who has been
    refunded money from the account.</li>
    <li>As a clan member - I want the ability to request a refund from the clan bank.</li>
    <li>As a clan leader - I want the ability to buy "gems" in the in-game shop to divide out amongst the members 
    who have donated.</li></ul> 

  ### **Sites Owners Goals**:
---
  <p>This is quite simple -</p> 
 <ul><li>Create a function that simulates more revenue.</li>
     <li>Increase functions in the game to make it more indepth and therefore a more enjoyable playing experience.</li>
     <li>Create something that is both functionable and practical for the player.</li>
     <li>Create something that is easy to use.</li>
 </ul>

 ### **User Requirements and Expectations**:
 ---
 #### Requirements:

* To enter the site with a user name and password (as this is beyond my capabilities for the moment, pressing
        enter will only be required for now.)
* To be able to visually capture an up-to-date balance of the clan banks treasures.
* Read and digest easily the information to hand.
* Send money to the clan bank if compelled to do so.
* Request money back if there has been a mistake in the donation or a mistake has a risen.
* To log out when finished.

#### Expectations:

* To be able to log in successfully.
* After logging in , to be taken to the main page.
* Information to be displayed in a way that is informative and easy to read.
* User experience is easy and uncomplicated to preform.
* Functionality is clean and quick in its operation.
* To follow in the games style and UX.
* For it to be visually appealing.
* For donations and refunds to be preformed correctly and without any negative user experience.

### **Design Choice**
---
  <p>The theme of this project is gaming and banking, thereforemy design choices have been heavily influenced by the actual games colours 
  and style. Using the developers tools on the fan based website for Clash of Clans, has helped and guided my choices to find similar 
  colours and schemes when creating this site.</p>

#### Fonts:
 <p>The fonts used by Supercell (who are the company that built and manage Clash of Clans) is.......
 so i choose to use ...... which is very close to this.</p>

#### Icons:
 <p>The icons used are to help the user to visually see and pick up easily what is being said without it being said. They are an added 
 feature that stimulates a visual reference for the user to break up the text.</p>

#### Colour:
  <p>Again the colours used would heavily follow what supercell are using so if i cannot repliate that i will use something
  that is very close or similar to it.</p>

  * Primary colours: would be ....

  * Seconadary colours would be .....

#### Styling:
   <p>Styling is there or thereabouts with supercells themes and visual repersentation of there ideas.
   But again this has been followed to the best of my current ability.</p>

   ##### Example:
   + Primary colour - #4ecdc4
   + etc..
   + etc...


   ##### Default-Styling:
   + Default-text-shadow - 1px 1px #000;
   + etc..
   + etc...

#### Background:
   <p>For the Background, i used images on all the pages including the log in , main bank page, donate and refund pages, the modals and
    the log out page. These where sourced at .... and i mite have needed to re - size to fit correctly into the screen sizes i am using 
    them for.</p>


## **Wireframes**: :hash:
---
<p>I built the wireframes for this project using balsamiq. I built separate wireframes for all three possible viewing devices - Desktop | 
Tablet | Mobile on balsamiq which if you follow the link below can be viewed:</p>

[View My Wireframes HERE](link to wireframes)



## **Features** 
---
   - Scrolling pages.
   - Links to several different pages.
   - Pop up modals to show extra features.


### Possible Further Features:

<p>Further additional features that could come about from this are more and more benefits from the relationship
between the bank and the shop. If and when the game creators add more and more userabilities to the shop the
bank will come into its own to fund these clan based features. Further cheaper gem packs from the shop would entice
clan members to donate more to the bank ,thus increasig revenue for the game creators. Ideas like clan packs rather
then just player targeted gem packs could become a feature of the future in the shop.</p>

##### Features Left to Implement

<p>Another feature idea conceived before the clash of clan-clan bank idea , was the clash of clan battle records
where the clan members but primarily the clan leaders could use more indepth statistics to visually see who 
is in the clan, proforming the best over the history of the clan and clan wars. This record would incorpurate
records on % of destruction , no of stars achieved per battle and total stars for the clan since joining
how many missed attacks that player has had since joining - to help the clan leaders put there best players 
forward in important battles and encourage and support those that are lagging behind or costting the clan
important victories</p>


## **Technology Used**: 
---
  ### Languages: 
  - Html5 - project requirement.
  - CSS3 - project requirement.

  ### Tools and Libraries:
   + Bootstrap - helps with the building of the project
